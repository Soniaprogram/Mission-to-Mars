# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of the analysis:


I am using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars' hemispheres and the titles of these images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a Flask web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accomoodate these images.
